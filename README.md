# CSS_Bootstrap-Responsive_Portfolio
## Description
#### This repository is where I created a responsive portfolio using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. In here, it would have working links menu in the navbar that send the user to the three pages which are contact, portfolio, and about. Contact page would have a form asking name, email, and message. Portfolio page would have placeholder images. Lastly, About page would have my image, information about me, and a link to my lindkein site. Using Bootstrap Grid System, I would be able to adjust the look of the webpage accordingly to the size of the screen.
